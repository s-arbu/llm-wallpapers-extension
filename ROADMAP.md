# Roadmap

The project is ready for a small GitHub-distributed beta. The Chrome Web Store release remains a later milestone with additional review and packaging work.

## Current: GitHub Beta

- Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude adapters are implemented.
- Wallpaper images and settings remain local to browser extension storage.
- Provider matching has unit coverage and public-page DOM monitoring.
- The extension can be built from source and downloaded as a GitHub release zip.
- Beta feedback is collected through GitHub Issues with provider, browser, route, and screenshot details.

## Beta Readiness

1. [x] Add authenticated Playwright checks for routes that are unavailable behind login walls.
2. [x] Add provider smoke checks that verify the overlay and stylesheet load, not only a landing-page selector.
3. [x] Run the checks across supported Chromium versions and document known provider-specific failures.
4. [x] Define a small issue template for provider, browser version, route, and screenshot.
5. [x] Freeze the wallpaper settings shape for the beta and document migration expectations.
6. [x] Document GitHub beta installation and release workflow.
7. [ ] Commit and push the release-ready changes, then create a version tag to publish the beta.

### Authentication blocker

Public landing-page checks do not prove that authenticated conversations, history, or saved sessions work. Playwright can load an authenticated browser context through `storageState`, but the state contains reusable session credentials and must be treated as a secret.

Recommended CI flow:

1. A maintainer creates a short-lived test account and captures `storageState.json` locally with Playwright.
2. The JSON is base64-encoded and stored as the GitHub Actions secret `PLAYWRIGHT_AUTH_STATE_B64`.
3. CI decodes it into the ignored path `playwright/.auth/storageState.json` only for the test run.
4. `playwright.config.ts` loads that file when present; local and forked runs remain unauthenticated.
5. Authenticated runs do not upload Playwright reports or traces, because they may contain conversation content or session-derived data.

This does not bypass authentication. It tests with an account the project maintainer controls. Rotate the state whenever the test account signs out, and never commit the decoded file.

## Later: Chrome Web Store Pre-release

- Chrome Web Store packaging and permissions review.
- Privacy review covering local image storage, host permissions, and authenticated test data handling.
- Manual verification on fresh install, upgrade, reset, and provider navigation flows.
- Release notes, support expectations, and a rollback version.

## V2: Wallpaper Sources

The proposed V2 direction is sound and should preserve the local-only boundary:

- Ship a small curated gallery of bundled presets that can be selected without an upload.
- Keep user-uploaded wallpapers as a separate source and preserve the current compression path.
- Store a stable preset id or local image data, not remote image URLs that can disappear or change.
- Defer cloud sync, accounts, and a shared user gallery until there is a clear privacy and hosting decision.

The gallery should follow beta stabilization so it does not add a second source of wallpaper state while provider behavior is still changing.
